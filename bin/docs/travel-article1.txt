The ultimate guide to Palm Springs

Palm Springs has Coachella going for it, but there's so much more to love beyond the famed festival. Located in the Coachella Valley, just a couple hours east of Los Angeles, Palm Springs is emerging as a top destination for a weekend getaway. And it's easy to see why with all it has to offer, with its stunning scenery, hot temps, cool shops, world-class restaurants and outstanding architecture. So if you're planning to take a breather in this beautiful spot, here are all the spots to add to your itinerary for an unforgettable weekend trip.
Shop around
Palm Springs is home to some of the best modern furniture, vintage and home d√©cor stores in the country. To add to your coffee table or candle collections, head to Just Fabulous. The store is filled with local wall art by the likes of Douglas Kirkland, cards that will make you LOL and JeffKoons-inspired piggy banks. Feeling flashy? The sparkly hand signs might just be for you.
Anyone who likes a good deal won't want to miss out on the Desert Premium Outlets. The sprawling outdoor outlet mall has the classics like J.Crew, Nike and Levi's, and every designer shop, from Marni, to Prada and Gucci. A quick half hour drive outside the city, you'll want to set aside at least half a day to cover off this mall from end to end. And for a chance to score last year's Gucci mules at discount, there's really no reason not to.

Sleep in style

If you're headed to Palm Springs for a little getaway, your best bet is probably booking an Airbnb. Why? Well, the options are endless, the prices are affordable and you can pick a spot for as many people as you need. Want an entire home with a backyard pool? No problem. If it's a guesthouse you're after, there are tons of picks for that too. Or if you're into the whole tipi thing, you can book one too.

For those who prefer checking-in to the trendiest hotels, you'll have a hard time choosing between The Ace Hotel and the Parker Palm Springs. Both are known for their impeccable decor, views, and legendary watering holes. A mean at the Ace Hotel's King's Highway restaurant is a must, and The Parker's brunch at Norma's is legendary from Palm Springs to New York City. Overall, The Ace is more of hipster scene, while design enthusiasts are more likely to enjoy Jonathan Adler's distinct designs at The Parker. At either, once you check-in, leaving will be difficult.
